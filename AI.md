# AI assistance in iP

## Introduction
This document serves as an outline for artificial intelligence's involvement with the individual project.

## Roles involved
- Feature Implementation: Honestly speaking, negligible or very minimal. Personally, I do not trust AI to handle implementation of logic for human systems.
- Code quality Checks: Heavy usage, especially in generation of javadoc comments, saves alot of time from typing out these comments and checking for grammar issues. One simply just does a quick read for what should be a short, succinct comment,
- Test Cases Generation: Heavy usage, JUnit tests should be clear and simple testing for simple scenarios especially at this stage.

Tools used: Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4 & Gpt 4.1)

## Evaluation
As a programmer who has been in the field since diploma-level, AI does help automate trivial, meagre tasks like test case generation and ensuring code quality by REMOVING HUMAN ERROR. This saved me a few hours, but in a larger project, the time saved will scale up.
